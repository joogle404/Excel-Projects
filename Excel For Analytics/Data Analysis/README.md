# Data Exploration
### 1. To start with data exploration, I first added a pivot table with the following fields.

### 2. I then applied some basic formatting and inserted a pivot chart (line graph) to get a basic understanding of the data.

### 3. On further expanding the line graph to show by months of each quarter, following graph was obtained and it showcased some seasonality.

### 4. Next up, I decide to do a variance analysis to see the year over year growth of Q1 and Q2.

### 5. I did a basic forecasting of what Q2 data would be based on the year over year growth percentage of Q1 (Q2 of 2020/(1-growth rate Q1))

The result shows that 61% of total volume should've consisted of NAM in Q2. However, a variance(forecasted Q2 data - actual Q2 data) of 4,416 existed, which is 30.6% of total variance.
Here, it is noted that LATAM shows the highest percentage of the total variance to our forecasted data (56.5%).
